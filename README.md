📧 Spam Mail Predictor

This project is a Spam Mail Predictor built using Python and Machine Learning. It helps classify emails as Spam or Not Spam, making your inbox safer and cleaner.

🚀 Features

Classifies emails as Spam or Ham (Not Spam)

Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text cleaning and processing

Machine Learning model for prediction (e.g., Naive Bayes or similar)

Jupyter Notebook for easy understanding and experimentation

⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/joshivbhav/spam_mail_predictor_system.git

cd spam_mail_predictor_system

Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
(Add a requirements.txt with libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, nltk)

Run the Notebook

jupyter notebook mailmodel.ipynb

🧩 How It Works

Data Preprocessing: The email text is cleaned (lowercased, tokenized, stop words removed).

Feature Extraction: Converts text to numerical data using techniques like Bag-of-Words or TF-IDF.

Model Training: A classification model (e.g., Multinomial Naive Bayes) is trained on labeled data.

Prediction: Given new email text, the model predicts if it’s spam or not.

✅ Results

High accuracy in detecting spam emails.

Easy to understand and modify for beginners.

Can be extended to production-level filters with more data.

📌 Usage

Run the notebook to train the model or test new emails.

You can modify the dataset and retrain for better results.

Integrate the model into your email pipeline with slight modifications.
